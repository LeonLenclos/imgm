imgm is an **image map game maker**. It allows you to create simple point and click games that use the html image map technology.

Here is a basic example of a game made with imgm : [The Pink Panther](https://leonlenclos.itch.io/pinkpanther)

An imgm game contains **scenes**, each scene is an image. On that image you define **gates**, gates are regions of the image that take the player to another scene when he click on it.

imgm does not helps you creating your game's images. Before making an imgm game, you must first gather pictures, drawings, screenshots or any images. The ideal size for images is 800x600 but imgm lets you crop and resize images when you import them.

imgm export a game as an easy-to-share single html file. An imgm game contains only html, css and image data (no javscript).
